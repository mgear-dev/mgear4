"""Qt/Maya-free silhouette math for the *trace from selection* tool.

Tracing a control turns its 3D shape points into a flat picker button shaped
like the control's silhouette: project the world-space points onto a view
plane (front / side / top), reduce them to a 2D convex hull (the approximate
outline), and scale the whole traced set to fit the canvas. These three steps
are pure geometry with no Qt or Maya dependency, so they are unit-testable
standalone (the same pattern as ``overlay`` and ``mirror``); the Maya point
extraction lives in ``handlers.maya_handlers.get_shape_points``.

Plane mapping (Maya is Y-up; the picker scene is also Y-up):
    front -> world (x, y)
    side  -> world (z, y)
    top   -> world (x, -z)

The top plane negates Z so the trace reads like Maya's top view, where +Z
points down the screen; without it the silhouette comes out vertically
inverted (front-of-rig at the top instead of the bottom).
