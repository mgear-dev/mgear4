Release Log
===========


5.3.5
------
**Enhancements**
	* Anim Picker: Autosave — the Save window gains an "Enable autosave" toggle and a minutes interval; on each interval, and when closing the picker with unsaved changes, it pops the same Save dialog as a clearly labeled "Autosave reminder" so you confirm where to write (node / file), never saving in the background; the settings persist via user preferences and unsaved-change detection now compares against a reliable load / save baseline instead of the node-vs-UI mismatch that always reported changes
	* Anim Picker: Background layers — right-click a layer for "Reveal in Folder" and "Copy Resolved Path", and hover a layer to see its resolved on-disk image path as a tooltip; all three use the same ``.pkr``-relative fallback search as image loading
	* Core: Add a reusable ``mgear.core.utils.reveal_in_file_browser`` helper that opens the OS file browser with a given path selected, falling back to the containing folder (Windows / macOS / Linux)
	* Docs: Anim Picker: Document portable ``.pkr`` paths via the ``ANIM_PICKER_PATH`` token, the background-image same-folder fallback and ``ANIM_PICKER_RELATIVE_IMAGES``, and the new autosave and background-layer path actions

**Bug Fix**
	* Anim Picker: SVG (vector) items now show a hover highlight like other buttons

5.3.4
------
**Enhancements**
	* Anim Picker: Opacity passthrough — a per-window "Passthrough" checkbox turns the transparent floating picker into a click-through HUD (masked to the item buttons and tabs; clicking a gap reaches the rig behind), with a move grip to drag it and the full window returning smoothly during pan / zoom
	* Anim Picker: Checkbox master-toggle for item groups — tag items into a named group and a checkbox widget shows / hides the whole group at once (with optional invert), in the picker with no rig attribute needed; composes with conditional visibility
	* Anim Picker: Editor undo/redo + focus-scoped keyboard shortcuts — a per-tab snapshot undo stack records every edit (a whole gesture is one step), with shortcuts (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z, Ctrl+C/V/X, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Shift+D, Delete, Ctrl+A, arrows, F, Esc) that fire only while the picker has focus
	* Anim Picker: Expand / contract spacing tools — four Align-section buttons spread the selection apart or pull it closer, horizontally or vertically, a step per click about its center
	* Anim Picker: Richer shape library with drag-to-create — 16 new templates (gear, face, hand, foot, arrows, heart, ring, eye, lock, ...) across Polygons / SVG tabs; click a tile to apply, drag to create on the canvas, or right-click to create one shaped item per selected control
	* Anim Picker: High-DPI text + handle scaling — on-canvas labels and edit-mode handles scale on a high-DPI display (150 / 200%) via ``pyqt.dpi_scale``; a no-op at 100%, and the authored text size stays display-independent
	* Anim Picker: Vector shapes from SVG — a picker item can be a real curved vector shape (filled or stroked); drag an ``.svg`` onto the canvas or use "Import SVG...", with graceful partial import (unsupported elements are discarded and reported); the parser ships as a reusable Qt/Maya-free ``mgear.core.svg_import``
	* Anim Picker: Conditional item visibility — show an item only when a Maya channel passes a comparison or the view zoom is within a range (set in the Visibility panel, with "Capture current" zoom); re-evaluated on selection / zoom / mouse-over, never per frame; edit mode shows all and a bad condition fails open
	* Anim Picker: Interactive widgets + trace from selection — an item can be a checkbox, 1D slider, or 2D slider bound to a Maya attribute and/or a script (drag a tile from the tool strip to create), and a Trace command (Front / Side / Top) builds one silhouette button per selected control, colored from it; also adds text alignment, backdrop containers (a titled panel that moves its contents together), and align / distribute tools
	* Anim Picker: Tab reorder + multi-tab view — drag tabs to reorder in edit mode, and a View selector (Tabbed / Grid / Rows / Columns) shows one tab or every tab's picker at once (each cell live); the mode and column count persist via user settings, not the ``.pkr``
	* Anim Picker: Pinned / overlay HUD buttons — pin an item to the viewport at a 3x3 anchor plus a pixel offset so it keeps a fixed screen position and size through pan / zoom, and is excluded from the pan / zoom extent
	* Anim Picker: Mirror relationships + color palette + shape library — link two items as a persistent, realtime-mirrored pair about a symmetry axis (pink dotted outline); a bottom left / center / right color palette colors the selection and mirrors the opposite side to its partner; a shape library applies premade shapes and saves custom ones
	* Core: Add a reusable ``PythonCodeEditor`` widget (``mgear.core.pycodeeditor``) — line-number gutter, current-line highlight, Python syntax highlighting, configurable monospace font and indentation, show-whitespace, and smart Tab / auto-indent; preferences persist via QSettings
	* Anim Picker: The custom script / menu editor now uses ``PythonCodeEditor`` with a File / Edit / View menu bar
	* Anim Picker: On-canvas item manipulators + inline multi-edit panel — a left tool strip toggles Select / Transform tools (scale and rotate handles on the selection), and a docked panel edits the whole selection at once (Transform / Appearance / Shape / Controls / Action, with fields that differ across the selection shown as "mixed")
	* Anim Picker: Re-enable dockable mode — an "Anim Picker (Dockable)" menu entry launches the picker as a Maya workspaceControl with a stable object name for clean re-open; the floating window stays the default
	* Anim Picker: On-canvas background-layer manipulators — in edit mode, select background image layers on the canvas (click / shift / marquee) and drag-move or handle-scale them
	* Anim Picker: Composite / flexible tab backgrounds — a tab background is an ordered list of positioned, sized image layers drawn back-to-front (managed from "Background layers..."); the canvas spans backgrounds and buttons so pan / zoom reach all content, removing the former 6000 size cap #108
	* Anim Picker: Modernize the module (Phase 1) — Python-3 idioms, ``mgear.log`` logging, Maya API 2.0 selection, decomposed modules, and dead-code cleanup; internal version bumped to 2.0.0
	* Anim Picker: Store picker data on the PICKER_DATAS node as clean JSON instead of an ``eval()``'d Python literal, removing arbitrary code execution on load. **BREAKING**: pickers stored only in a scene node with no external ``.pkr`` file must be re-exported

**Bug Fix**
	* Anim Picker: Show the vector "SVG" hover badge only in edit mode, so hovering a vector item in animation mode no longer flashes it
	* Anim Picker: The selection / hover item border is now a cosmetic constant-screen-width outline, so it stays readable when the canvas is zoomed far out
	* Anim Picker: Fix editor undo not clearing an added optional property (group / visibility / SVG / pin / widget / backdrop / text / controls / menus / mirror) — the undo restore now resets keys absent from the snapshot
	* Anim Picker: Vector (SVG) items no longer show dead polygon handles ("Toggle handles" is a no-op for them); also removed the redundant right-click Options entry
	* Anim Picker: Fix the shape library's "Save current shape" staying disabled with an item selected — it now reads the live selection when clicked
	* Anim Picker: Fix the backdrop title and SVG badge being clipped on high-DPI displays — both size their font from the container height (DPI-independent), the title elides, and the badge pill grows to its text
	* Anim Picker: Fix slider / 2D-slider knob leaving a ghost after a drag — the widget's bounding rect now includes the knob radius so the old position is repainted
	* Anim Picker: Fix "Picker shape from curve not working" #598 — remove the JSON-to-Python-literal replace hack that corrupted control names containing "true", and guard shape-less transforms
	* Anim Picker: Fix latent bugs in ``picker_node`` / ``maya_handlers`` — a ``.format()`` typo, a ``setAttr`` that never hid the data node, an assertion that never fired on referenced nodes, and an always-false dict type check

5.3.3
------
**Enhancements**
	* Core: Curve: Add public shape-copy helpers create_curve_shape_under, copy_curve_display_attrs, and CURVE_DISPLAY_ATTRS for geometry-level NurbsCurve copy via OpenMaya
	* Core: Logging: mgear.log() handler exceptions now surface to stderr instead of being silently swallowed; remaining handlers still receive the message
	* Solvers: Build: Add Maya 2022 support to Windows build script

**Bug Fix**
	* Shifter: Fix extract controls performance regression — slow on top-level controls with many descendants; now uses parentOnly duplicate + OpenMaya MFnNurbsCurve.create for constant-time-per-control extraction, while preserving the prior fix's safety guarantees (no child leaking, no mesh/locator shapes, ghost-control independence) and propagating display attributes to the buffer
	* Shifter: Build Log: Fix custom step messages disappearing from the build log on the second and subsequent builds when the window was kept open; the window now reuses the live instance across builds (preserves filter buttons, font size, and search text), display hooks always bind to the live handler, and log content clears at the start of each new build
	* SimpleRig: Convert to Shifter Rig now disconnects driven matrix chains (mgear_mulMatrix + decomposeMatrix) before deleting the simple-rig root, preventing orphaned utility nodes with broken driver inputs in the converted scene

5.3.2
------
**Enhancements**
	* Core: Skin: Add soft selection support to Copy Skin Partial — falloff vertices are blended proportional to Maya's rich-selection falloff instead of producing a hard seam at the selection boundary
	* Rigbits: Evaluation Partition: Store short names in .evp configs (v2.0) for portability across scenes, namespaces and rig reorganizations, with explicit ambiguity errors and backwards-compatible v1.0 loading
	* SimpleRig: Auto-skin walks the subtree under each driven, binding every mesh / NURBS descendant to the correct joint and respecting nested controls via a claim-set, so controls attached to plain transforms no longer skip their geometry
	* Utilbits: Bookmarks: Store short names with namespace (v2.0), per-bookmark "Use Selected Object's Namespace" toggle to drive one bookmark across multiple rig instances, ambiguity detection, backwards-compatible v1.0 loading
	* Utilbits: Random Colors: Remember original shading-group assignments for restoration, add Toggle and Remove operations, Apply-to-all (mesh + NURBS) option with NURBS surface support
	* Docs: Rigbits: Add Evaluation Partition scripting examples (execute_from_file, execute_full_pipeline, per-step usage)
	* Docs: SimpleRig: Add user documentation

**Bug Fix**
	* Anim Picker: Fix rendering with PySide6 / Linux #609, remove dead __USE_OPENGL__ code path #580
	* SimpleRig: Fix KeyError in Convert to Shifter Rig when the control hierarchy has sibling branches of unequal depth (parent could be processed after child)
	* Utilbits: Matcap Viewer: Fix shader restore and selection handling — skip intermediate shapes, match SG members via both short and full DAG paths for face-based restores, abort "Apply to Selected" on empty selection, and clear residual matcap_SG before restore

5.3.1
------
