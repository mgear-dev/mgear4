2. Open Guide > Diff Tool
3. Load a reference template to compare against
4. Select comparison options and run the test
5. Review differences and update as needed

.. _guide-settings:

Guide Settings
==============================================

The Guide Settings panel provides comprehensive control over how your rig is built. Access these settings by selecting the guide root and opening the settings from the Guide Manager or by using **Shifter > Guide Settings**.

.. image:: images/shifter/guide_settings/guide_settings.png
    :align: center

.. _main-guide-settings:

Main Settings
--------------

The main settings tab controls the core behavior of your rig build.

Rig Identity
++++++++++++++++++

**Rig Name**

The name used for the generated rig. This name is used as the root group name and affects naming throughout the rig hierarchy.

**Mode**

- **Final**: Production-ready rig build
- **WIP**: Work-in-progress mode for development and testing

**Build Step**

Controls how much of the rig build process to execute. Useful for debugging or incremental builds:

- **All Steps**: Complete rig build
- **Objects**: Create geometry and control shapes only
- **Properties**: Add attributes to objects
- **Operators**: Setup deformers and constraints
- **Connect**: Connect components together
- **Joints**: Create joint structure
- **Finalize**: Cleanup and optimization

World Control
++++++++++++++++++

**World Control**

When enabled, uses ``world_ctl`` instead of the component-based ``global_C0_ctl`` as the top-level control.

**World Control Name**

Custom name for the world control (default: "world_ctl").

Animation Channels
++++++++++++++++++

**Proxy Channels**

Add internal proxy channels for animation data transfer.

**Classic Channel Names**

Use unique full names for all channels, ensuring no naming conflicts across the rig.

**Attribute Prefix Name**

Use the component instance name instead of the type name for attribute prefixes, providing more specific attribute naming.

Joint Settings
++++++++++++++++++

**Separated Joint Structure**

Create a separate joint hierarchy independent from the control hierarchy. This is the recommended workflow for game engines and clean deformation setups.

**Force World Oriented**

Orient all joints to world space rather than inheriting local orientations.

**Force Uniform Scaling**

Force all joints to use uniform scaling, preventing non-uniform scale issues in deformation.

**Connect to Existing Joints**

Connect the rig to pre-existing joints in the scene, useful for updating rigs without losing skin weights.

**Force Segment Scale Compensation**

Apply segment scale compensation (SSC) to all joints for consistent scaling behavior.

Skinning
++++++++++++++++++

**Import Skin**

Automatically load pre-saved skin weights during rig build.

**Skin Path**

Path to the ``.gSkin`` file containing skin weight data.

Color Settings
++++++++++++++++++

**Use RGB Color**

When enabled, uses RGB color values instead of Maya's color index system for control colors.

**Color Indices (0-31)**

Maya color palette indices for controls:

- **Left FK/IK Color**: Colors for left-side FK and IK controls
- **Right FK/IK Color**: Colors for right-side FK and IK controls
- **Center FK/IK Color**: Colors for center FK and IK controls

**RGB Color Values**

When RGB mode is enabled, specify exact RGB values for each control type.

Data Collection
++++++++++++++++++

**Collect Data on External File**

Save rig data to an external file for pipeline integration.

**Data Collector Path**

Path to the ``.gnx`` file where rig data will be saved.

**Collect Data Embedded**

Store rig data directly in the root joint's attributes.

**Custom Joint for Data**

Specify an alternative joint for storing embedded data.

.. _custom-steps:

Custom Steps
--------------

Custom Steps is one of the most powerful features in mGear's data-centric workflow. It allows you to extend the rig build process with custom Python scripts that execute before or after the main build, enabling infinite customization possibilities.

.. image:: images/shifter/guide_settings/custom_steps.png
    :align: center

The Data-Centric Workflow
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

mGear follows a data-centric architecture where custom steps can:

- **Read and modify shared data** through a step dictionary passed between all steps
- **Access built rig components** to modify controls, joints, and connections
- **Execute at specific build phases** (pre-build or post-build)
- **Be organized in groups** for logical categorization and management
- **Be referenced from external files** for team sharing and reusability

This architecture enables you to build a library of reusable customization scripts that can be applied across multiple rigs and shared across teams.

Pre vs Post Custom Steps
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Pre-Custom Steps**

Execute BEFORE the main rig build process. Use these for:

- Preparing the scene (cleaning up, organizing)
- Setting up data that components will use
- Validating guide structure before building
- Creating helper objects that components need

**Post-Custom Steps**

Execute AFTER the main rig build is complete. Use these for:

- Adding custom controls or attributes
- Setting up space switches
- Creating selection sets
- Applying color overrides
- Building custom deformers
- Connecting to external systems

Step Data Structure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each custom step contains:

- **Name**: Display name for the step (e.g., "apply_colors")
- **Path**: Relative or absolute path to the Python script
- **Active**: Toggle to enable/disable the step without removing it

**Path Resolution**

Paths can be specified as:

- **Absolute paths**: Full system path to the script
- **Relative paths**: Resolved against the ``MGEAR_SHIFTER_CUSTOMSTEP_PATH`` environment variable

**Inactive Steps**

Steps can be deactivated by unchecking their checkbox. Inactive steps are preserved in the configuration but skipped during execution, making it easy to temporarily disable steps for testing.

Groups
++++++++++++++++++

Groups allow you to organize custom steps into logical collections. This is especially useful for complex rigs with many customization steps.

**Group Features:**

- **Collapsible**: Groups can be collapsed/expanded in the UI to reduce clutter
- **Master Active Control**: Disabling a group disables all steps within it
- **Drag and Drop**: Reorder groups and move steps between groups
- **Visual Organization**: Group related steps (e.g., "Face Setup", "Hand Controls", "Space Switches")

**Creating Groups:**

1. Right-click in the custom steps area
2. Select "Create New Group"
3. Enter a name for the group
4. Drag existing steps into the group or add new steps directly

**Group Hierarchy:**

Steps within groups inherit the group's active state. If a group is disabled, all contained steps are skipped even if individually marked as active.

Context Menu
++++++++++++++++++

Right-click on steps or groups to access additional options:

.. image:: images/shifter/guide_settings/custom_steps_right_click_menu.png
    :align: center

- **Edit Step**: Open the Python file in your configured external editor
- **Run Step**: Execute the step individually for testing
- **Toggle Active**: Enable/disable the step
- **Delete**: Remove the step or group
- **Create New Group**: Add a new group for organization
- **Load Referenced Group**: Import steps from an external ``.scs`` file

External File References (.scs)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Custom steps can be referenced from external Shifter Custom Steps (``.scs``) files. This enables:

- **Team Sharing**: Share step configurations across team members
- **Version Control**: Track step configurations in source control
- **Reusability**: Apply the same steps to multiple rigs
- **Centralized Updates**: Update steps in one place, apply to all rigs

**SCS File Format (JSON):**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "items": [
            {
                "type": "group",
                "name": "Animation Setup",
                "collapsed": false,
                "active": true,
                "items": [
                    {
                        "type": "step",
                        "name": "space_switches",
                        "path": "steps/space_switches.py",
                        "active": true
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "step",
                        "name": "selection_sets",
                        "path": "steps/selection_sets.py",
                        "active": true
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

**Loading Referenced Groups:**

1. Right-click in the custom steps area
2. Select "Load Referenced Group"
3. Browse to your ``.scs`` file
4. The group is added as a read-only reference

**Referenced Group Behavior:**

- Referenced groups appear with a special indicator
- Individual steps cannot be edited (read-only)
- You can toggle the active state of the entire group
- Updates to the source ``.scs`` file are reflected when the rig is rebuilt

Writing Custom Steps
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Custom steps are Python classes that inherit from ``customShifterMainStep``:

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.shifter.custom_step import customShifterMainStep

    class CustomShifterStep(customShifterMainStep):

        def setup(self):
            """Initialize the step - set the name"""
            self.name = "my_custom_step"

        def run(self):
            """Execute the step logic"""
            # Access the rig object
            rig = self.rig

            # Access a specific component
            arm = self.component("arm_L0")

            # Access all components of a type
            fk_components = self.components_by_type("EPIC_arm_01")

            # Access data from previous steps
            previous_step = self.custom_step("other_step_name")

            # Create organization group for custom objects
            setup_root = self.get_or_create_setup_root()

Available Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**self.rig**

Alias for ``self.mgear_run`` providing intuitive access to the Shifter rig object. Use this to access rig-wide data and controls.

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        # Access the global control
        global_ctl = self.rig.global_ctl

        # Access the rig's setup group
        setup_grp = self.rig.setupWS

        # Get all components
        all_components = self.rig.components

**self.guide**

Access to the guide object from the rig build (if available).

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        if self.guide:
            # Access guide data
            guide_model = self.guide.model

Available Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**self.component(name)**

Get a component by its full name (e.g., "arm_L0"). Raises ``KeyError`` if the component is not found.

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        # Get a specific component
        arm = self.component("arm_L0")

        # Access component controls
        fk_ctl = arm.fk_ctl
        ik_ctl = arm.ik_ctl

**self.has_component(name)**

Check if a component exists without raising an error. Returns ``True`` if the component exists, ``False`` otherwise.

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        # Safely check for optional components
        if self.has_component("tail_C0"):
            tail = self.component("tail_C0")
            self.log("Found tail component")
        else:
            self.log("No tail component in this rig", level="warning")

**self.components_by_type(comp_type)**

Get all components of a specific type. Returns a list of matching components.

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        # Get all control_01 components
        all_controls = self.components_by_type("control_01")
        for ctrl in all_controls:
            self.log("Found control: {}".format(ctrl.fullName))

        # Process all arm components
        arms = self.components_by_type("EPIC_arm_01")
        for arm in arms:
            # Apply custom setup to each arm
            self.setup_arm_spaces(arm)

**self.custom_step(name)**

Access a custom step that has already been executed. Raises ``KeyError`` if the step hasn't run yet.

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        # Access data from a previous step
        color_step = self.custom_step("apply_colors")
        colors_used = color_step.color_palette

**self.has_custom_step(name)**

Check if a custom step has been executed without raising an error.

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        # Check for optional dependency
        if self.has_custom_step("proxy_setup"):
            proxy = self.custom_step("proxy_setup")
            # Use proxy data
        else:
            self.log("Proxy setup not available", level="warning")

**self.get_or_create_setup_root(name)**

Get or create a setup root group for organizing custom step objects. The group is automatically parented under the rig's setup group.

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        # Create a setup group for this step's objects
        setup_grp = self.get_or_create_setup_root()

        # Create custom objects and parent them
        my_locator = pm.spaceLocator(name="custom_loc")
        pm.parent(my_locator, setup_grp)

        # Use a custom name for the setup root
        custom_grp = self.get_or_create_setup_root("my_custom_setup")

**self.log(message, level)**

Log a message with the step name as a prefix. The ``level`` parameter can be "info" (default), "warning", or "error".

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        self.log("Starting custom step processing")
        # Output: [my_custom_step] Starting custom step processing

        self.log("Missing optional attribute", level="warning")
        # Displays as Maya warning

        self.log("Critical error occurred", level="error")
        # Displays as Maya error

Running Sub-Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**self.run_sub_step(module_name, step_path)**

Load and run another custom step from an external module. This powerful method enables modular step design by allowing you to break complex operations into smaller, reusable steps.

The sub-step will have access to the same step dictionary, components, and rig context as the parent step.

**Parameters:**

- ``module_name``: The name of the Python module/file without the ``.py`` extension
- ``step_path`` (optional): The directory path where the module is located. If not provided, checks the ``MGEAR_SHIFTER_CUSTOMSTEP_PATH`` environment variable

**Basic Usage:**

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        # Run a sub-step from a specific path
        self.run_sub_step("apply_colors", "W:/my_steps")

        # Run a sub-step using MGEAR_SHIFTER_CUSTOMSTEP_PATH env var
        self.run_sub_step("setup_spaces")

        # Run a sub-step that's already in Python's path
        self.run_sub_step("mirror_controls")

**Accessing Sub-Step Data:**

.. code-block:: python

    def run(self):
        # Run the sub-step and get immediate access
        color_step = self.run_sub_step("apply_colors", "W:/my_steps")
        self.log("Colors applied: {}".format(color_step.colors_applied))

        # Or access it later via custom_step()
        self.run_sub_step("setup_proxies", "W:/my_steps")
        # ... other code ...
        proxy_step = self.custom_step("setup_proxies")

**Modular Step Architecture Example:**

Main step file (``main_setup.py``):

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.shifter.custom_step import customShifterMainStep

    class CustomShifterStep(customShifterMainStep):

        def setup(self):
            self.name = "main_setup"

        def run(self):
            self.log("Running main setup...")

            # Run color application
            self.run_sub_step("apply_colors", "W:/steps")

            # Run space switching setup
            self.run_sub_step("setup_spaces", "W:/steps")

            # Run selection sets creation
            self.run_sub_step("create_sets", "W:/steps")

            self.log("Main setup complete!")

Sub-step file (``apply_colors.py``):

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.shifter.custom_step import customShifterMainStep

    class CustomShifterStep(customShifterMainStep):

        def setup(self):
            self.name = "apply_colors"
            self.colors_applied = []

        def run(self):
            self.log("Applying control colors...")

            # Get all arm components and apply colors
            arms = self.components_by_type("EPIC_arm_01")
            for arm in arms:
                # Apply color logic
                self.colors_applied.append(arm.fullName)

            self.log("Applied colors to {} components".format(
                len(self.colors_applied)))

**Benefits of Sub-Steps:**

- **Modularity**: Break complex setups into focused, single-purpose steps
- **Reusability**: Share common operations across multiple rigs
- **Maintainability**: Update individual sub-steps without modifying the main step
- **Testing**: Test sub-steps independently before integrating
- **Team Collaboration**: Different team members can work on different sub-steps

Step Dictionary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All steps share a common dictionary (``customStepDic``) that enables inter-step communication:

- Each executed step is stored in this dictionary using its name as the key
- Steps can access data set by previous steps via ``self.custom_step(name)``
- Sub-steps are automatically registered in this dictionary
- Use this for passing complex data between steps

.. _custom-step-templates:

Custom Step Templates
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When creating a new custom step, mGear provides a template selection dialog that offers pre-built templates for common tasks. This accelerates development by providing ready-to-use code patterns.

**Accessing Templates:**

1. Click the **New** button in the Custom Steps panel
2. A template selection dialog appears with a dropdown menu
3. Select a template and click **OK**
4. Choose a save location for your new custom step file
5. The file is created with the selected template code

**Available Templates:**

- **Blank**: Empty custom step with ``setup()`` and ``run()`` methods. Use this as a starting point for completely custom logic.

- **Import Skin Pack**: Imports skin weights from a ``.gSkinPack`` file. Useful for re-applying skin weights after rig rebuilds.

- **Import Guide Visualizer Configuration**: Imports guide visualizer settings (display curves, colors, labels) from a JSON file.

- **Import RBF Configuration**: Imports RBF Manager setups from a JSON file exported by the RBF Manager tool.

- **Import SDK Configuration**: Imports Set Driven Keys from a JSON file exported by the SDK Manager tool.

- **Import Eye Rigger Configuration**: Builds eye rigs from Eye Rigger 2.1 JSON configuration files. Supports separate left and right eye configurations.

- **Import Channel Master Configuration**: Imports Channel Master node configuration from a ``.cmc`` file.

- **Import Anim Picker Template**: Imports Anim Picker data from a ``.pkr`` file with an option to reparent the picker node under the rig root.

**Template Configuration Options:**

Each template provides three ways to configure file paths:

1. **Hardcoded Path**: Set the path directly in the script for automated builds

   .. code-block:: python

       self.config_path = "path/to/your/config.json"

2. **Relative Path**: Use a path relative to the script location

   .. code-block:: python

       import os
       script_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
       self.config_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "config.json")

3. **File Dialog**: Leave as ``None`` to show a file dialog at runtime (default)

   .. code-block:: python

       self.config_path = None

**Adding Custom Templates:**

Templates are stored in ``mgear/shifter/custom_step_templates/``. To add a new template:

1. Create a new Python file in the ``custom_step_templates`` folder
2. Define a ``TEMPLATE`` variable containing the template code as a raw string
3. Use ``{stepName}`` as a placeholder for the step name (replaced during creation)
4. Escape any curly braces in the template with double braces ``{{}}``
5. Register the template in ``__init__.py`` by adding an entry to the ``TEMPLATES`` dictionary

Example template file:

.. code-block:: python

    """My Custom Template description."""

    TEMPLATE = r'''import mgear.shifter.custom_step as cstp

    class CustomShifterStep(cstp.customShifterMainStep):

        def setup(self):
            self.name = "{stepName}"

        def run(self):
            self.log("Running my custom step...")
            return'''

.. _blueprint-guide:

Blueprint Guide
--------------

The Blueprint Guide feature enables studios to define standardized rig settings that can be shared across multiple characters. This powerful data-centric workflow allows you to create a master template from which individual rigs inherit their settings, while still allowing per-section and per-component local overrides.

.. image:: images/shifter/blueprint_guide/blueprint_main_settings_tab.png
    :align: center

Overview
++++++++++++++++++

A **Blueprint Guide** is a serialized guide template (``.sgt`` file) that serves as a base configuration for your rig settings. When enabled, your guide inherits settings from the blueprint, and you can selectively override specific sections or components as needed.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Standardization**: Define rig settings once and share them across multiple characters
- **Efficiency**: Only customize what's different per character
- **Propagation**: Changes to the blueprint automatically apply to all characters using it
- **Flexibility**: Full control over which settings to inherit vs. override locally

Enabling Blueprint Guide
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Open the Guide Settings panel by selecting the guide root
2. Navigate to the **Blueprint** tab
3. Check **Enable Blueprint Guide**
4. Click the browse button (**...**) to select a ``.sgt`` file
5. The status will show the resolved path if the file is found

**Path Resolution:**

Blueprint paths can be specified as:

- **Absolute paths**: Full system path to the ``.sgt`` file
- **Relative paths**: Resolved against the ``MGEAR_SHIFTER_CUSTOMSTEP_PATH`` environment variable

Guide Settings Local Override
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When a blueprint is enabled, each section in the Guide Settings tab becomes controllable via a **Local Override** checkbox in the section title.

.. image:: images/shifter/blueprint_guide/guide_main_settings_local_override.png
    :align: center

**Override Behavior:**

- **Unchecked (Blue Title)**: Section inherits settings from the blueprint. Widgets are disabled and greyed out.
- **Checked (Blue Title)**: Section uses local settings. Widgets are enabled and editable.

**Sections with Local Override:**

- Rig Settings
- Animation Channels Settings
- Base Rig Control
- Skinning Settings
- Joint Settings
- Post Build Data Collector
- Color Settings
- Naming Rules (separate tab)
- Pre Custom Steps (Custom Steps tab)
- Post Custom Steps (Custom Steps tab)

Custom Steps Blueprint Integration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Custom Steps tab has special blueprint integration features accessible via the **Blueprint** menu.

.. image:: images/shifter/blueprint_guide/blueprint_custom_steps.png
    :align: center

**Blueprint Menu Options:**

- **Show Blueprint Pre Custom Steps**: Toggle visibility of blueprint's pre-custom steps (read-only view)
- **Show Blueprint Post Custom Steps**: Toggle visibility of blueprint's post-custom steps (read-only view)
- **Make Pre Custom Steps Local**: Copy blueprint pre-custom steps to local for editing
- **Make Post Custom Steps Local**: Copy blueprint post-custom steps to local for editing

When viewing blueprint custom steps, they appear with a **[Blueprint]** prefix and are read-only. Use the "Make Local" commands to copy them to your local guide for modification.

Component Blueprint Settings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Individual components can also inherit settings from the blueprint. When a blueprint is active and contains a matching component (same name, side, and index), a blueprint header appears above the component settings tabs.

.. image:: images/shifter/blueprint_guide/blueprint_component_settings.png
    :align: center

**Component Blueprint Header:**

- **Blue Indicator**: Shows that the component exists in the blueprint
- **Blueprint Local Override**: Checkbox to use local settings instead of blueprint
- **View**: Opens a dialog showing the blueprint's settings for this component
- **Copy**: Copies all blueprint settings to local and enables local override

Guide Explorer Color Coding
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When a blueprint is active, the Guide Explorer tree uses color coding to indicate each component's blueprint status.

.. image:: images/shifter/blueprint_guide/guide_explorer_color_coding.png
    :align: center

**Color Legend:**

- **Blue Text**: Component exists in blueprint and is using blueprint settings (no local override)
- **Yellow/Orange Text**: Component exists in blueprint but has local override enabled
- **Default Text**: Component does not exist in the blueprint

This visual feedback makes it easy to see at a glance which components are inheriting from the blueprint and which have been customized locally.

Blueprint Workflow Example
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Creating a Blueprint:**

1. Build a master guide with your studio's standard settings
2. Configure all guide settings, naming rules, custom steps, and component settings
3. Export the guide as a template: **Shifter > Export Guide Template**
4. Save as your blueprint ``.sgt`` file (e.g., ``studio_biped_blueprint.sgt``)

**Using a Blueprint:**

1. Create or open a character-specific guide
2. Enable Blueprint Guide and select your blueprint file
3. All sections default to inheriting from the blueprint
4. Check **Local Override** only on sections that need character-specific settings
5. Build your rig - it will use blueprint values for non-overridden sections

**Updating a Blueprint:**

1. Modify the blueprint ``.sgt`` file
2. All guides using that blueprint will automatically use the new settings on their next build
3. Local overrides are preserved - only non-overridden sections receive the updates

.. _naming-rules:

Naming Rules
--------------

The Naming Rules panel allows you to customize how controls, joints, and other rig elements are named. This is essential for pipeline integration and studio naming conventions.

.. image:: images/shifter/guide_settings/name_rules.png
    :align: center

Naming Templates
++++++++++++++++++

Naming rules use tokens that are replaced with actual values during rig build:

- ``{side}``: The side identifier (L, R, C)
- ``{component}``: The component name
- ``{description}``: Additional description from the component
- ``{index}``: Numerical index
- ``{type}``: Element type (ctl, jnt, etc.)

**Control Naming Rule**

Template for control names. Default: ``{side}_{component}_{description}_{index}_{type}``

Example result: ``L_arm_fk_001_ctl``

**Joint Naming Rule**

Template for joint names. Default: ``{side}_{component}_{description}_{index}_{type}``

Example result: ``L_arm_fk_001_jnt``

Side Names
++++++++++++++++++

Customize the side identifiers used in naming:

- **Left Name**: Default "L" (e.g., could be "left" or "lf")
- **Right Name**: Default "R" (e.g., could be "right" or "rt")
- **Center Name**: Default "C" (e.g., could be "center" or "cn")

**Joint Side Names**

Separate side naming for joints if different from controls:

- **Joint Left Name**: Default "L"
- **Joint Right Name**: Default "R"
- **Joint Center Name**: Default "C"

Name Extensions
++++++++++++++++++

Suffixes added to element names:

- **Control Extension**: Default "_ctl" (e.g., could be "_ctrl" or "_CON")
- **Joint Extension**: Default "_jnt" (e.g., could be "_joint" or "_JNT")

Letter Case
++++++++++++++++++

Control how descriptions are capitalized:

- **Default**: Keep original case
- **Upper Case**: Convert to uppercase (e.g., "FK" instead of "fk")
- **Lower Case**: Convert to lowercase (e.g., "fk" instead of "FK")
- **Capitalization**: Capitalize first letter (e.g., "Fk" instead of "fk")

These can be set independently for controls and joints.

Index Padding
++++++++++++++++++

Control zero-padding for numerical indices:

- **Control Index Padding**: Number of digits (e.g., 3 = "001", "002")
- **Joint Index Padding**: Number of digits for joint indices

Setting to 0 uses no padding (e.g., "1", "2", "10").

Import/Export Naming Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Save and load naming configurations for consistency across projects:

**Save Configuration**

Export current naming rules to a ``.naming`` JSON file for backup or sharing.

**Load Configuration**

Import naming rules from a previously saved ``.naming`` file.

**Configuration File Format:**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "ctl_name_rule": "{side}_{component}_{description}_{index}_{type}",
        "joint_name_rule": "{side}_{component}_{description}_{index}_{type}",
        "side_left_name": "L",
        "side_right_name": "R",
        "side_center_name": "C",
        "side_joint_left_name": "L",
        "side_joint_right_name": "R",
        "side_joint_center_name": "C",
        "ctl_name_ext": "_ctl",
        "joint_name_ext": "_jnt",
        "ctl_description_letter_case": 0,
        "joint_description_letter_case": 0,
        "ctl_index_padding": 0,
        "joint_index_padding": 0
    }

Plebes - Instant Rigged Characters Using mGear
==============================================

Plebes is a simple template based tool to quickly rig characters from various character generators, such as DazStudio, Character Creator 3,  MakeHuman or Mixamo. What it does is build an mGear rig that matches the proportions of your character, and then constrains the joints of that character to the rig with just a few clicks.

.. image:: images/shifter/plebes_ui.png

How to Rig Plebes
-----------------

1) Open Plebes interface from the mGear>Shifter>Plebes... menu.
2) Export the character from the character generator as FBX and bring it into Maya.
3) Select the **Character Template** that matches your character generator.
4) Follow the template specific instructions in the Plebes interface.
5) Press **Import Guides** to import the mGear biped guides.
6) Press **Align Guides** to align the mGear guides to your character's joints.
7) Look over the guides, and manually adjust any that are off (e.g. typically the heel and sides of the feet).
8) Press **Build Rig** to build the rig.
9) Press **Attach Plebe to Rig** to constrain the character to the mGear rig. This  also removes any locks, keys/connections and/or limits on the translate, rotate and scale attributes on the character's original joints.

You can delete the rig, adjust the guides and rebuild it, like you can normally with mGear, by simply deleting the "rig" group and running the last two steps again.

.. note::
   Some character generators build their characters with completely straight or misaligned elbows and knees, which makes it impossible for mGear to figure out where to aim the knee or elbow, so you may need to rotate the joints slightly before aligning the guides to them, to make sure they are pointing in the right direction.

Known Limitations
-----------------

Plebes is meant to quickly rig generic characters, typically for use in the background or for crowd agents, so has some limitations. If you need more of a hero rig, you can use the guide placement as a starting point, but it's probably a good idea to skin the character directly to your mGear joints, rather than using **Attach Plebe to Rig**. Other known limitations include:

- Stretching and scaling of limbs may not work correctly for all templates, though it should work fine for all "normal" animation.
- Some characters come with additional joints, such as face joints, that Plebes does not add any controls to.

Plebe Templates
---------------

What gets aligned and constrained to what is defined by simple JSON templates. Plebes ships with templates for the several commonly used character genrators, but should you want to add more or modify the existing ones, you can easily do so. You can define the location of additional templates by defining the environment variable PLEBE_TEMPLATES_DIR. You can have multiple template dirs, so you can add your custom ones from your home folder or project specific ones as needed, just make sure each tamplate has a unique name.

The templates look like this:


.. code-block:: json

    {
        "help": "This show up when you hover over the template menu.",
        "root": "CC_Base_BoneRoot",
        "guides": [
            {"guide": "CC_Base_BoneRoot"},
            {"neck_C0_tan0": [
                "CC_Base_NeckTwist01",
                "CC_Base_NeckTwist02"
            ]}
        ],
        "settings": [
            {"arm_L0_root": [
                { "div0": 1 },
                { "div1": 1 },
                { "supportJoints": 0}
            ]}
        ],
        "joints": [
            {"local_C0_ctl": {
                "joint": "CC_Base_BoneRoot",
                "constrain": "111"}
            },
            {"spine_C0_0_jnt": {
                "joint": "CC_Base_Hip",
                "constrain": "110"}
            }
        ]
    }

- **help** - Documentation that shows up in the interface, detaling any specific things you need to do to work with this template.
- **root** - The top level joint/node from the character generator.
- **guides** - List of which guides to position at which joints.
    - If you match it to a list of joints, like with the neck above, it will be placed between them.
- **settings** - Settings to adjust on the guides before building the rig. Typically this is number of twist joints, but can be any attribute and value combination.
- **joints** - List of mGear joints and which of the character's joints to constrain to it.
    - **joint** - Name of the character's joint to constrain to mGear.
    - **constain** - Three 0 or 1's. First is if to point constraint, second is orient and third is scale.

.. _shifter-fbx-exporter:

Shifter's FBX Exporter
==============================================

The FBX exporter, allows you to export FBXs, as well having an integration into Unreal.

It supports the following Unreal processes:

- Exporting SKMs
- Exporting SKMs and using existing Skeletons
- Exporting Animation
- Exporting Animation layers

UI
-----------------

.. image:: images/shifter/fbx_exporter/fbx_shifter.png

* **File** - Allows for users to serialise there settings, incase they want to reload them, or use them in a scripted pipeline.


Source Elements
++++++++++++++++++

These are the elements that make up the FBX, Geometry and Skeleton structure.

.. image:: images/shifter/fbx_exporter/fbx_shifter_roots.png
    :align: center

In the image above you can see that the **geo_root** is a group that contains all the geometry objects.

**Geo Root**: The list of geometry object roots. There can be more then one depending on how you have structured your character.

**Joint Root**: The root bone of the skeleton.

Settings
++++++++++++++++++

You can specify the FBX export settings here.

It also allows for some extra conditioning of the data upon export.

- Remove Namespace
- Clean up scene.

File Path
++++++++++++++++++

- **Directory**: Location of the exported FBX files.
- **File Name**: Name of the fbx file that will be generated. This will also be used as the name of the **Unreal Assets**.

Unreal Engine Import
++++++++++++++++++++++

- **Enable Unreal Engine Import**: Enabling this, will allow for the other Unreal UI elements to become active. 
It also **refreshes** the **Unreal Skeleton** list, by querying the current open Unreal Project.

.. image:: images/shifter/fbx_exporter/fbx_shifter_ue_no_path.png
    :align: center

.. note::
    If you have selected a skeleton and no longer what to import using the selected skeleton, or wish to generate a new skeleton on import, ctr click on the selected element to deselect it.

- **Directory**: The import location in Unreal for the SKM and Animations.

    .. image:: images/shifter/fbx_exporter/fbx_shifter_ue_select_folder.png
        :align: center
    1) Navigate to the folder in Unreal that you want to import to.
    2) Select the folder in Unreal's **Content Browser**
    
    .. image:: images/shifter/fbx_exporter/fbx_shifter_ue_path.png
        :align: center

- **Blendshapes**: Export Blendshapes that exist on the geometry.
- **Partitions**: Export Partitioned FBXs.
- **Cull Joints**: With Cull Joints enabled, generated fbx partition files will have all unneccesary leaf nodes removed.
*Unnessary leaf nodes*, would be any joint that is no longer driving geometry and no longer required to drive any other joints that has skinning, to influence geometry that is part of the partition.

.. note::
    Exporting the Skeletal Mesh, will trigger a mayabatch session, that performs all the file conditioning, and then performs the fbx exporting.

**Partitions**

Performs partitioning of geometric data.
Partitions are designed to allow you to export once, and generate an FBX per a partition. Each generated FBX partition, will only contain the geometry that has been added to the partition.

- When you add the **geometry roots**, all geometry child objects will get added to the **Master** partition.

.. image:: images/shifter/fbx_exporter/fbx_shifter_export_geo_partitions.png
        :align: center

- Press the **"+"** button to create a custom partition. Once it has been created you can drag any other geometry objects from the master partition, to the custom partition.
- Right click on a Partition to change its colour, duplicate or delete it.
- Toggling the button on the partition, will disable it from being exported.

**Export Skeletal/SkinnedMesh**: Performs the FBX export, and if **"Enable Unreal Engine Import"** is active, the fbx's will be imported into the active Unreal Engine project.

.. note::
    If you want to use a pre-existing skeleton in Unreal, make sure to have selected the *skeleton* in the *Unreal Engine Imports* section. If you have not, a new Skeleton will be generated on import into Unreal. 

Animation

New Clips will automatically read the duration of the Maya timeline, and use that as the start and end frame.

- **Trash can**: Removes the clip.
- **Name of the clip** will be appended to the file. eg. *BoyA_ROM*, *BoyA_Clip_2*
- **Drop-down**: represents the animation layer that will have its animation read, and exported as the final FBX.
- **Start Frame**: The frame number that the animation will start at.
- **End Frame**: The frame number that the animation will end at.
- **Set timeline range**: Updated Mayas timeline to fit the range that is specified.
- **Play**: Plays back the clip on loop.
- **Tick Box**: Disabled the animation clip, stopping the clip from being exported.



**Animation Layers**

.. image:: images/shifter/fbx_exporter/fbx_shifter_animation_cb.png
        :align: center

- **None**: Uses the current configuration of active and disabled Animation Layers. Exporting exactly what you see in scene.
- Any other selected animation layer, will export the **Animation Layer** and **Mayas BaseAnimation**

Disconnects the rig's deformation joints from the control rig, allowing the joints to be manipulated independently or exported without the rig overhead.

This is useful for:

- Preparing joints for game engine export
- Creating standalone skeletal meshes
- Testing deformation without rig influence

Connect Joints
---------------

Reconnects previously disconnected joints back to the rig using matrix constraints. This restores the rig's control over the deformation joints.

Use this to:

- Re-enable rig control after testing
- Reconnect joints after modifications
- Restore the full rig functionality

Delete Rig + Keep Joints
-------------------------

Removes the entire rig structure while preserving the deformation joints. This is the recommended workflow for creating final game-ready assets.

This operation:

- Deletes all control curves and rig hierarchy
- Preserves the joint chain with current transforms
- Maintains skin weights and connections to geometry
- Creates a clean skeleton ready for export

Game Tool Disconnect + Assembly IO
-----------------------------------

Opens an advanced interface combining joint disconnection tools with Assembly IO functionality for complex game export workflows.

Features include:

- Batch disconnect/reconnect operations
- Assembly-based export configurations
- Custom export presets
- Integration with FBX export pipeline

.. _auto-fit-guide:

Auto Fit Guide
==============================================

Auto Fit Guide provides tools for automatically fitting Shifter guide positions to a target character mesh. The tool has two modes accessible via tabs: **Relative Guide Placement** for recording and transferring guide positions between meshes, and **Auto Fit Biped** for automatic biped guide placement using Maya's skeletal embedding.

Access from the menu: **Shifter > Auto Fit Guide**

.. image:: images/shifter/auto_fit_guide.png
    :align: center

Relative Guide Placement (RGP)
-------------------------------

Records guide positions relative to a reference mesh surface, then repositions them onto a different mesh. This is the primary workflow for transferring a guide setup from one character to another.

**Source Mesh**

Select the reference mesh that the guides are currently fitted to.

**Sample Vertices**

Controls how many nearby vertices are used to compute each guide's reference position (1-128, default 32). Higher values produce more stable placement but take longer to record. Use 1 for legacy single-vertex behavior.

**Skip Nodes**

Two configurable lists control which guides are excluded from the placement process:

- **Skip Crawl**: Guides to skip entirely during hierarchy traversal and placement (e.g., ``controllers_org``, UI components). Includes sensible defaults.
- **Skip Orientation**: Guides that update position only, preserving their current rotation. Useful for guides where orientation is manually set and should not change.

Use the Add/Remove buttons to manage each list. Nodes are mutually exclusive between lists. Click **Reset Defaults** to restore the factory configuration.

**Workflow**

1. Select or load a guide in the scene
2. Set the **Source Mesh** to the mesh the guides currently match
3. Click **Record Relative Guide Placement** — records each guide's position relative to the mesh surface (progress bar shows status)
4. Replace or modify the mesh (e.g., swap to a new character body)
5. Click **Update Guide Placement** — repositions all guides to match the new mesh surface

**Options**

- **Reset Default Scale**: When checked, resets guide scale to (1,1,1) during update
- **Reference Mesh Override**: The update can target a different mesh than the one used during recording

**File Operations (File menu)**

- **Export Relative Placement (.rgp)**: Save recorded placement data as JSON
- **Import Relative Placement (.rgp)**: Load previously recorded placement
- **Export/Import Skip Config (.srgp)**: Save and load skip node configuration separately

**C++ Acceleration**

When the compiled acceleration module is available, recording and updating use optimized C++ code with BFS flood-fill and multi-vertex reference matrices. This is significantly faster for complex rigs with 100+ guides. The tool automatically falls back to pure Python if the C++ module is not installed.

Auto Fit Biped (AFB)
---------------------

Automatically creates and positions biped rig guides using Maya's skeletal embedding system. This analyzes a character mesh and generates an internal skeleton that guides are matched to.

**Embed Node Settings**

- **Source Geometry**: The character mesh to analyze
- **Embed Resolution**: Voxel grid resolution (64, 128, 512, 1024). Higher values are more accurate but slower
- **Embed Type**: Segmentation method — Perfect Mesh, Watertight Mesh, Imperfect Mesh, or Polygon Repair (default). Choose based on your mesh quality
- **Mirror Embed Nodes**: Mirror the generated skeleton left-to-right or right-to-left
- **Smart Adjust**: When enabled, automatically adjusts the embed output — makes arm planes consistent, centers hips between legs, aligns spine, and adjusts hand positions

**Action Buttons**

- **Create Embed Nodes**: Generate skeleton joints from the mesh analysis
- **Match Guides**: Position existing guides to match the embed skeleton
- **Create and Match (Run All)**: Full pipeline — create, smart adjust, mirror, and match in one step
- **Delete Embed Nodes**: Remove the temporary embed skeleton

**Association Info**

Maps embed skeleton points to Shifter guide nodes. The tool includes 18 default biped points (hips, back, shoulders, head, and left/right limbs).

- **Interactive Association**: Toggle on, then select an embed node followed by guide nodes to create custom mappings
- **Enable Match Position**: When checked, guides snap to position as you create associations interactively
- **Mirror Left to Right**: Mirror left-side associations to the right side
- **Apply Default Associations**: Load the standard biped template mapping
- **Clear/Print Associations**: Manage and inspect the current mapping

**File Operations (File menu)**

- **Export AFG Association (.afg)**: Save custom associations as JSON
- **Import AFG Association (.afg)**: Load previously saved associations
