Add NPO
===========

Add a transform as parent of each selected object in order to neutralize the local values to the reset position

.. figure:: images/rigbits/npo_before.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 95%

    The tranlate X and Y have some values

Gimmick Joints
==============

Rigbits > Gimmick Joints opens a window to add helper joints for deformation, mirror them to the other side, and save them to a file.

.. image:: images/rigbits/gimmick_joint_tool.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 95%

Gimmick joints don't need a built Shifter rig. When the joints belong to a Shifter rig, the rig's joint naming rules are used to find the side of each joint, so custom side names work. Otherwise the usual side tokens are used (``L0_``, ``_L_``, ``_L`` and the right side ones).

All the new joints are added to the ``rig_deformers_grp`` set, which is created if it doesn't exist.

Create
------

- **Add Joint**: Adds a deformer joint driven by each selected object. The joint is parented under ``jnt_org`` if it exists, otherwise under the object.
- **Add Blended Joint**: Adds a ``blend_<joint>`` joint for each selected joint. The blended joint follows the joint's translation and a part of its rotation, set with the **Blend** value (0.5 rotates it half way). It is placed under the joint's parent.

.. image:: images/rigbits/gimmick_joints.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 95%

- **Add Support Joint**: Adds a ``blendSupport_<index>_<joint>`` joint under each selected blended joint. Support joints help with deformation and are usually driven later with SDK or RBF.

Mirror
------

Mirrors the blended joints, and their support joints, from Left to Right or from Right to Left. With nothing selected, all the gimmick joints of the side are mirrored; otherwise only the selected ones. Each mirrored blended joint is created for the mirrored joint with the same blend value, and each support joint keeps its index and gets the mirrored position and orientation. Mirrored joints that already exist are kept, unless **Replace** is on.

Flip Support Orientation
------------------------

Adds 180 degrees to the joint orient of the selected support joints on X, Y or Z.

Select / Delete
---------------

Selects or deletes the gimmick joints of the checked sides. Deleting a blended joint also deletes its support joints and its pairBlend node.

Import and Export
-----------------

The **File** menu imports and exports gimmick joints to a ``.gst`` file: all of them, or only the selected ones (with the support joints of the selected blended joints). Import rebuilds the blended joints on their source joints and then the support joints, and skips the ones whose joint is missing in the scene.

With mGear file drop enabled (see :ref:`file-drop`), dragging a ``.gst`` file into Maya's viewport imports it.

.. note::
    Blended and support joints made by older mGear versions are recognised by the tool and can be mirrored, selected and exported. The Rigbits commands ``rigbits.addBlendedJoint()`` and ``rigbits.addSupportJoint()`` keep working in custom steps and create the same joints as the window.

Shifter Custom Step
-------------------

To rebuild the gimmick joints with the rig, export them to a ``.gst`` file, then create a post custom step from the **Import Gimmick Joints Configuration** template (see :ref:`custom-step-templates`) and set its options in ``setup()``:

- ``self.gimmick_path``: the ``.gst`` file. Leave it as ``None`` to pick the file when the step runs.
- ``self.replace``: delete gimmick joints with the same names before rebuilding them.

The step can also be written by hand. A minimal post custom step:

.. code-block:: python

    import mgear.shifter.custom_step as cstp
    from mgear.rigbits.gimmick_tool import core


    class CustomShifterStep(cstp.customShifterMainStep):
        def setup(self):
            self.name = "gimmick_joints"

        def run(self):
            core.import_file("C:/rig/data/hero.gst")

To create the joints in code instead of from a file, use the Rigbits functions or the gimmick core:

.. code-block:: python

    from maya import cmds

    import mgear.shifter.custom_step as cstp
    from mgear.rigbits.gimmick_tool import core


    class CustomShifterStep(cstp.customShifterMainStep):
        def setup(self):
            self.name = "elbow_gimmicks"

        def run(self):
            for side in ("L", "R"):
                blend = core.create_blend_joint("arm_{}0_1_jnt".format(side), blend=0.5)
                support = core.create_support_joint(blend)
                cmds.setAttr(support + ".translateY", 1.0)

File Format
-----------

``.gst`` files are JSON. The ``type`` key is ``"gimmick_joints"`` and the ``joints`` list holds the blended joints (source joint, blend value, comp scale, radius and color) and then the support joints (blended joint, local translate, rotate, joint orient, scale, rotate order, radius and color). Files exported by the old Gimmick Setup Tool can also be imported.

Scripting Access
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits.gimmick_tool import core

    # Create
    blend = core.create_blend_joint("arm_L0_1_jnt", blend=0.5)
    support = core.create_support_joint(blend)

    # Find
    core.list_gimmick_joints()                            # all
    core.list_gimmick_joints(kind=core.BLEND, side=core.LEFT)
    core.get_source_joint(blend)                          # "arm_L0_1_jnt"

    # Mirror all the Left gimmick joints to the Right side
    core.mirror_gimmick_joints(direction=core.LEFT_TO_RIGHT)

    # Export and import
    core.export_file("C:/rig/data/hero.gst")
    core.import_file("C:/rig/data/hero.gst", replace=True)

    # Open the window
    from mgear.rigbits.gimmick_tool import ui
    ui.show()


Replace Shape
==============

Replace the shape of one object shape with another

.. image:: images/rigbits/gif/replace_shape.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 95%


Match All Transform
===================

Align one object to another object using the world Matrix reference.


Match Pos with BBox
===================

Center the position of an object in the center of the bounding box of an object.


Align Ref Axis
==============

Create a reference locator axis based on a point selection. This command needs at less 3 points.

.. image:: images/rigbits/gif/Align_ref_axis.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 95%

.. Tip::

	Very useful to find rotation axis in mechanical rigs if the transformations of the mesh have been freeze.


CTL as Parent
==============

Create a control of the selected shape as parent of each selected object.


Ctl as Child
==============

Create a control of the selected shape as child of each selected object.


Duplicate Symmetrical
======================

Duplicate and mirror the selected object and his children. This is done by negating some axis scaling and inverting some of the values. This will provide a mirror behavior.
Also handle some renaming. i.e: from _L to _R

RBF Manager
===========

A tool to manage a number of RBF type nodes under a user defined setup(name)

Steps -
    set Driver
    set Control for driver(optional, recommended)
    select attributes to driver RBF nodes
    Select Node to be driven in scene(Animation control, transform)
    Name newly created setup
    select attributes to be driven by the setup
    add any additional driven nodes
    position driver(via the control)
    position the driven node(s)
    select add pose

Add notes -
Please ensure the driver node is NOT in the same position more than once. This
will cause the RBFNode to fail while calculating. This can be fixed by deleting
any two poses with the same input values.

Edit Notes -
Edit a pose by selecting "pose #" in the table. (which recalls recorded pose)
reposition any controls involved in the setup
select "Edit Pose"

Delete notes -
select desired "pose #"
select "Delete Pose"

Mirror notes -
setups/Controls will succefully mirror if they have had their inverseAttrs
configured previously.

Space Manager
=============

Create and manage space switches for rig controls. Space switches allow controls to follow different parent spaces (world, local, custom targets).

.. image:: images/rigbits/spaceManager.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

**Constraint Types:**

* **Parent** - Full transform constraint (position, rotation, scale)
* **Point** - Position only constraint
* **Orient** - Rotation only constraint
* **Scale** - Scale only constraint

**Menu Types:**

* **Enumerated** - Dropdown attribute for discrete space selection
* **Float** - Blend attribute for smooth space interpolation

**Workflow:**

1. Select the control that needs space switching
2. Add target spaces (objects to follow)
3. Choose constraint type and menu type
4. Create the space switch

**Import/Export:**

Space configurations can be saved and loaded as .smd files for reuse across rigs.

Space Jumper
============

Create a local reference space from another space in the hierarchy. This creates a non-cyclic space relationship using matrix math.

**Usage:**

1. Select the reference space (parent transform)
2. Select the jump space (child space to reference)
3. Run Space Jumper

The tool creates ``_SPACE_`` and ``_JUMP_`` transforms connected via ``gear_mulmatrix_op`` for clean space relationships.

Interpolate Transform
=====================

Create a transform that blends between two objects using matrix interpolation.

.. image:: images/rigbits/interpolated_transform.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

**Usage:**

1. Select the first object (A)
2. Select the second object (B)
3. Run Interpolate Transform

Creates a new transform with ``_INTER_`` naming that interpolates 50% between both objects. Uses ``gear_intmatrix_op`` for smooth matrix-based blending.

Connect Local SRT
=================

Connect Scale, Rotation, and/or Translation attributes between objects.

.. image:: images/rigbits/connect_local_SRT_menu.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

**Options:**

* **Connect SRT** - Connect all three (Scale, Rotation, Translation)
* **Connect S** - Scale only
* **Connect R** - Rotation only
* **Connect T** - Translation only

**Usage:**

1. Select the source object (first)
2. Select target objects
3. Choose which attributes to connect

Channel Wrangler
================

Move or proxy channels between nodes with a visual table interface.

With mGear file drop enabled (see :ref:`file-drop`), dropping a ``.cwc`` file into Maya applies its channel rules.

.. image:: images/rigbits/channel_wrangler.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

**Operation Modes:**

* **Move Channel** - Physically move the channel from source to target
* **Proxy Channel** - Create a proxy attribute that mirrors the source

**Move Policies:**

* **merge** - Merge with existing channels
* **index** - Match by channel index
* **fullName** - Match by full attribute name

**Proxy Policies:**

* **index** - Match by channel index
* **fullName** - Match by full attribute name

**UI Features:**

* Visual table with Index, Channel, Source, Target, Operation columns
* Channel and Target line edits with picker buttons
* Set Multi-Channel and Set Multi-Target for batch operations
* Import/Export configurations as .cwc JSON files

Eye Rigger
==========

Automatic eyelid rigging tools.

Eye Rigger 3.0
--------------

Open it from **mGear > Rigbits > Facial Rigger 3.0** (Eye tab). It builds the
same eyelid rig as Eye Rigger 2.1, with these changes:

* **Vertex or edge loop:** rig from a selected vertex loop (the default) or
  set **Loop Type** to Edge. Eye Rigger 2.1 configurations build from their
  edge loop.
* **Any eye orientation:** corners and the upper and lower lids are found in
  the loop's own frame, so tilted and side facing eyes work without the scene
  up axis. **Side Range** remains as an override.
* **Mirror Behavior** (on by default): the right side controls mirror the
  left ones, so the same values give a mirrored pose. The aim control doesn't
  mirror: the same rotation aims both eyes the same way. Joint names are the
  same as 2.1, numbered from the inner corner on both sides, so existing skin
  files still load.
* **Shared settings:** the settings are also used by the upcoming Shifter
  eyelid component. **Export Config** saves a ``.eyes`` file and **Import
  Config** loads 3.0 and 2.1 files.
* **Smooth contact:** near the end of a blink the lids blend to the closed
  shape, so they meet without a jump.
* **Fixes:** a joint every 0 vertex, the fixed joint count on the lower lid,
  name clashes when building both eyes, the lower lid moving off the mesh at
  rest, and the lids opening at full blink.
* Every option has a tooltip, and the controls and deformers sets can be
  picked from the selection.

Scripts and custom steps build from a file with
``mgear.rigbits.facial_rigger3.eye.rig_from_file(path)``, or the **Import
Facial Rigger 3.0 Configuration** custom step template. Existing scripts and
custom steps using ``mgear.rigbits.facial_rigger2.eye_rigger`` keep building
the Eye Rigger 2.1 rig.

Eye Rigger 2.1
--------------

The previous eye rigger, in **mGear > Rigbits > Facial Legacy > Eye Rigger
2.1**. Its configuration files load in Eye Rigger 3.0.

    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

Similar functionality to version 2.1 with the original parameter set including blink height percentage control.

Lips Rigger
===========

Automatic lip rigging from edge loops.

.. image:: images/rigbits/lips_rigger.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

**Key Features:**

* Lip edge loop setup for upper and lower lips

Proxy Geo
=========

Create proxy geometry for joints with multiple creation modes.

.. image:: images/rigbits/ProxyGeo.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

**Creation Modes:**

* **Proxy to Next** - Extends geometry toward the next joint in chain
* **Proxy Centered** - Creates geometry centered at joint position
* **Proxy to Children** - Aims geometry at child joints

**Shape Types:**

* **Capsule** - Rounded cylinder shape
* **Box** - Rectangular box shape

**Build Modes:**

* **Add** - Add new proxy geometry
* **Replace** - Replace existing proxy geometry

**Features:**

* Duplicate and Mirror existing proxies
* Combine multiple proxies into single mesh
* Export/Import proxy configurations as .pxy files
* Automatic axis alignment
* Build Tip Joint option for end joints

**Proxy Attributes:**

Created proxies have custom attributes for identification and configuration:

* ``isProxy`` - Boolean marker
* ``proxy_shape`` - "capsule" or "box"
* ``proxy_axis`` - Axis alignment
* ``side`` / ``length`` - Dimension attributes

Proxy Slicer
============

Create proxy geometry by analyzing skin cluster weights and splitting the mesh per joint influence. Uses OpenMaya2 for fast batch weight queries.

**How it works:**

1. Batch-queries all skinCluster weights via OpenMaya2 (single API call)
2. Groups faces by their dominant joint influence
3. Creates separate proxy meshes per joint
4. Names proxies as ``JointName_Proxy``
5. Handles locked transforms from skinned meshes (unlocks for operations, re-locks after parenting)

**Usage:**

Select one or more skinned meshes and run Proxy Slicer. The system automatically creates proxy geometry based on skin weights, with each proxy representing the area most influenced by that joint. Multiple meshes are processed in sequence.

Works with meshes that have additional deformers after the skinCluster (softMod, cluster, etc.) since it searches the full deformation history.

Proxy Slicer Parenting
======================

Same as Proxy Slicer but parents the created proxies directly under their influence joints instead of grouping them separately.

**Difference from Proxy Slicer:**

* **Proxy Slicer** - Creates a ProxyGeo group with matrix constraints to influence joints
* **Proxy Slicer Parenting** - Parents proxies directly under influence joints, re-locks transform attributes

**Python API:**

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits import proxySlicer

    # Slice a single mesh (world-space mode with matrix constraints)
    proxySlicer.slice(parent=False, oSel="body_geo")

    # Slice with direct parenting under influence joints
    proxySlicer.slice(parent=True, oSel="body_geo")

    # Slice multiple meshes
    proxySlicer.slice(oSel=["body_geo", "head_geo", "hands_geo"])

    # Slice current selection (supports multi-select)
    proxySlicer.slice()

    # Slice current selection with parenting
    proxySlicer.slice(parent=True)

SDK Manager
===========

The SDK Manager is a tool for creating and managing Set Driven Keys (SDKs) in mGear rigs. It provides a streamlined workflow for setting up SDK-based facial rigs and corrective shapes using joints.

.. image:: images/rigbits/sdk_manager/SDK_manager_UI.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

Overview
--------

The SDK Manager workflow is based on Judd Simantov's facial rigging techniques, using joints and SDKs to create facial shapes with the control of joints and weighting rather than blendshapes.

**Advantages:**

* Same results as blendshape-based face rigs with extreme control over every shape
* Expose tweak controls for every joint to animators
* Fits into the rebuild workflow - pivots and controllers can be altered without destroying rig work
* Export/import weight maps, guides, and SDKs between characters
* Can add blendshapes on top for further deformation

SDK Tab
-------

The main SDK tab provides the core functionality for setting driven keys.

**Driver Section:**

* Click the **Driver** button with a control selected to set it as the driver
* Choose the **Driver Attribute** from the dropdown to select which attribute drives the SDKs
* Enable **Show Only Connected Driver Attributes** to filter the dropdown to attributes that already have SDKs

**Key Channels:**

Select which channels to key on the driven controls:

* **Translate** - with individual X, Y, Z checkboxes
* **Rotate** - with individual X, Y, Z checkboxes
* **Scale** - with individual X, Y, Z checkboxes

This allows you to key only specific axes (e.g., only Translate Y and Rotate Z) rather than all channels.

**Driven Section:**

* Click **Add Selected Joints To Driven** to add SDK controls to the driven list
* Select items in the list and click **Set Driven Key** to create SDKs at current values
* Use the navigation buttons (<<, <, |, >, >>) to jump between existing key values
* Use the **Driver Val** slider and spin box to scrub the driver value
* The -1, -0.5, 0, +0.5, +1 buttons provide quick value adjustments

**Save Slots:**

The five save slot buttons allow you to store and recall SDK control positions:

* Click with controls selected to save their current values
* Click again to restore saved values
* Ctrl+Click to clear the slot

Right-Click Menu
----------------

Right-click on items in the driven list for additional options:

Wire to Skinning
================

A tool for creating wire deformers and converting them to skin clusters using the de Boor algorithm for NURBS-based weight computation.

.. image:: images/rigbits/wire_to_skinning/wire_to_skinning_UI.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

Overview
--------

Wire to Skinning provides a workflow for:

1. **Creating wire deformers** from edge loops or joints
2. **Converting wire deformers to skin clusters** with precise B-spline weight distribution
3. **Export/Import configurations** for reusable wire setups

This tool is particularly useful for facial rigging, secondary deformation, and any setup requiring smooth, NURBS-based weight falloff.

.. Tip::

    Wire deformers are excellent for quick deformation tests. Use this tool to convert your wire setup to production-ready skin clusters once you're happy with the result.

Create Wire Section
-------------------

The top section allows creating wire deformers using two methods:

**Edge Loop Mode:**

* Select edges from the mesh to define the wire curve path
* Specify the number of CVs for the curve (more CVs = more joints/control)
* The curve is rebuilt to match the target CV count

**Joint Mode:**

* Select existing joints to define the wire curve
* The curve CVs are connected to joints via ``mgear_curveCns`` deformer
* Moving joints automatically updates the wire curve
* Joint ordering options: Selection order, Hierarchy, or Position X

**Common Parameters:**

* **Mesh** - Target mesh for the wire deformer
* **Wire Name** - Base name for the created wire deformer
* **Dropoff** - Wire influence falloff distance

Existing Wires Section
----------------------

Displays all wire deformers currently affecting the selected mesh.

* **Refresh** - Update the wire list
* **Select** - Select the wire deformer in Maya
* **Remove** - Delete the wire deformer and its curves

Convert to Skin Section
-----------------------

Converts wire deformers to skin clusters using the de Boor algorithm for B-spline basis function evaluation.

**Wire Selection:**

* **All Wires** - Convert all wire deformers on the mesh
* **Selected Wire** - Convert only the selected wire from the dropdown

**Joint Options:**

* **Auto-create joints** - Create joints at each curve CV position

  * **Prefix** - Naming prefix for auto-created joints
  * **Parent Joint** - Optional parent for the joint chain

* **Custom joints** - Use manually specified joints (must match CV count)

**Conversion Parameters:**

* **Static Joint** - Joint for vertices outside wire influence (default: ``static_jnt``)
* **Delete Wire** - Remove the wire deformer after conversion

**How Conversion Works:**

1. For each vertex, finds the closest point on the wire curve
2. Computes B-spline basis functions at that parameter using de Boor's algorithm
3. Distributes weights across nearby joints based on curve continuity
4. Blends with existing skin weights or assigns to static joint for unaffected areas

.. Tip::

    When converting a wire created from joints, the tool automatically uses those connected joints for skinning - no need to manually specify them.

Configuration Export/Import
---------------------------

Save and load wire configurations for reuse across scenes or characters.

**File Menu:**

* **Export Configuration** - Save wire setup to a ``.wts`` file
* **Import Configuration** - Load wire setup from a ``.wts`` file

**Exported Data:**

* Wire deformer settings (dropoff, scale, envelope)
* Curve CV positions
* Connected joint names (for joint-mode wires)
* Conversion settings

**Import Behavior:**

* Recreates wire deformers from saved curve data
* For joint-connected wires, automatically reconnects to existing joints
* Falls back to static curves if referenced joints don't exist

.. Tip::

    Enable mGear file drop (see :ref:`file-drop`) to import ``.wts`` files by dragging them into Maya's viewport.

Scripting Access
----------------

The tool's core functions are available for scripting:

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits import wire_to_skinning

    # Show the UI
    wire_to_skinning.show()

    # Create wire from edges
    positions = wire_to_skinning.get_edges_positions(edges)
    curve = wire_to_skinning.create_curve_from_positions(positions, num_cvs=8)
    wire = wire_to_skinning.create_wire_deformer(mesh, curve, dropoff_distance=5.0)

    # Create wire from joints
    wire, curve, curvecns = wire_to_skinning.create_wire_from_joints(
        mesh, joints, dropoff_distance=5.0, name="lip_wire"
    )

    # Convert wire to skin
    curve_info = wire_to_skinning.get_curve_info(curve)
    wire_info = wire_to_skinning.get_wire_deformer_info(wire)
    weights, uses_static = wire_to_skinning.compute_skin_weights_deboor(
        mesh, curve_info, wire_info, wire_deformer=wire
    )
    joints = wire_to_skinning.create_joints_at_cvs(curve_info, prefix="lip")
    skin = wire_to_skinning.create_skin_cluster(mesh, joints, weights)

    # Export/Import configuration
    wire_to_skinning.export_configuration(mesh, "/path/to/config.wts")
    wire_to_skinning.import_configuration("/path/to/config.wts", target_mesh=mesh)

**Core Module Functions:**

The underlying functions are also available in ``mgear.core`` modules:

* ``mgear.core.curve.getCurveInfo()`` - Get curve CVs, degree, knots
* ``mgear.core.deformer.createWireDeformer()`` - Create wire deformer
* ``mgear.core.deformer.getWireDeformerInfo()`` - Get wire deformer attributes
* ``mgear.core.deformer.getWireWeightMap()`` - Get per-vertex wire weights
* ``mgear.core.deformer.getMeshWireDeformers()`` - Find wire deformers on mesh
* ``mgear.core.skin.getCompleteWeights()`` - Get skin weights by vertex

.. _evaluation-partition:

Evaluation Partition
====================

The Evaluation Partition tool splits a mesh into polygon group partitions to optimize Maya's parallel evaluation. By dividing a dense mesh into independent sub-meshes, each partition can be evaluated in parallel, improving playback performance for complex character rigs.

Access from the menu: **mGear > Rigbits > Evaluation Partition**

.. image:: images/rigbits/evaluation_partition_ui.png
    :align: center

Overview
--------

The tool works by defining polygon groups on a source mesh and then executing an 8-step pipeline that creates independent partition meshes with all deformers transferred.

.. image:: images/rigbits/evaluation_partition_sample.png
    :align: center

Polygon Groups
--------------

Define which faces belong to each partition using the Polygon Groups section.

- **Default Group**: Contains all faces not assigned to other groups
- **Add Group from Selection**: Select faces in the viewport and click to create a new group
- **Add/Remove faces**: Use the ``+`` and ``-`` buttons on each group to add or remove selected faces
- **Select**: Click to select the group's faces in the viewport
- **Color coding**: Each group displays with a unique color shader for visual reference

Pipeline Steps
--------------

When you click **Execute Partition**, the tool runs an 8-step pipeline:

1. **Split Polygon Groups**: Creates independent meshes from each polygon group
2. **Transfer Blendshapes**: Captures blendshape targets via wrap-based baking, including in-between targets
3. **Clean Unused BS Targets**: Removes targets with zero delta on each partition
4. **Reconnect BS Inputs**: Replicates weight driver connections. For combo targets (multiply networks from SHAPES or similar), builds independent multiply chains per partition
5. **Copy Skin Clusters**: Transfers skin weights from source to each partition
6. **Remove Unused Influences**: Cleans influences with zero weight on each partition
7. **Copy Skin Configuration**: Copies skinCluster settings (skinningMethod, normalizeWeights, dqsScale connections, prebind matrices). Reproduces localized skinCluster connections (``mgear_mulMatrix``) if the source uses ``localize_skin_clusters``
8. **Proximity Wrap Proxy**: Creates a proxy mesh with proximity wrap for any remaining deformation

Visibility Controls
-------------------

Per-partition visibility attributes are created on the partitions root group node, allowing individual partitions and the proxy geometry to be toggled on and off.

Configuration
-------------

Save and load partition configurations using the **File** menu.

- **Export Configuration**: Save polygon groups and settings to a ``.evp`` file
- **Import Configuration**: Load a previously saved ``.evp`` file

Scripting Access
----------------

Launch the UI:

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits import evaluation_partition
    evaluation_partition.show()

Run from a ``.evp`` configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``execute_from_file`` is the main entry point for pipeline automation and scripting. It loads a ``.evp`` file, creates a ``PolygonGroupManager``, and assigns the partition shaders to the mesh. It does **not** run the 8-step pipeline by itself — it only prepares the manager so you can inspect it, modify it, or feed it to the pipeline.

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits import evaluation_partition as evp

    # Load the config and build the manager (shaders are created and assigned)
    manager = evp.core.execute_from_file("D:/configs/character_body.evp")

    # Optional: override the mesh stored in the config
    # manager = evp.core.execute_from_file(
    #     "D:/configs/character_body.evp",
    #     mesh="body_geo",
    # )

**Returns:** a ``PolygonGroupManager`` instance, or ``None`` if loading failed.

The manager holds the in-memory state reconstructed from the ``.evp`` file:

* ``manager.mesh`` — target mesh (long name)
* ``manager.groups`` — list of ``PolygonGroup`` objects, each with ``name``, ``color``, ``face_indices``, ``shader_node``, and ``shading_group``

This is useful for:

1. **Feeding the pipeline.** Every step function takes a manager as input. ``execute_from_file`` is the scripted way to get one without opening the UI.
2. **Previewing / QC.** Shaders are already assigned, so you can visually verify the partition in the viewport before executing the split.
3. **Inspecting or tweaking groups in code.** Iterate ``manager.groups`` to validate face counts, rename, recolor, or adjust face assignments (``add_faces_to_group``, ``remove_faces_from_group``, ``update_group_color``, ``rename_group``) before running the pipeline.
4. **Running a subset of steps** on the same manager (e.g. only split + skin copy, skipping blendshapes).

Run the full 8-step pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The typical scripted flow is: load the config, then hand the manager to ``execute_full_pipeline``.

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits import evaluation_partition as evp

    manager = evp.core.execute_from_file("D:/configs/character_body.evp")

    # Optional: inspect or modify the manager here
    # for group in manager.groups:
    #     print(group.name, len(group.face_indices))

    grp, partitions, proxy = evp.core.execute_full_pipeline(manager)

Run individual pipeline steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you only need a subset of the pipeline, call the step functions directly on the manager. Step 1 (``split_polygon_groups``) must run first because it produces the partition meshes that every later step operates on.

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits import evaluation_partition as evp

    manager = evp.core.execute_from_file("D:/configs/character_body.evp")

    # Step 1 — split the source mesh into partition meshes
    grp, partitions = evp.core.split_polygon_groups(manager)

    source = manager.mesh

    # Step 2 — transfer blendshapes
    evp.core.transfer_blendshapes(source, partitions)

    # Step 3 — clean unused BS targets
    evp.core.clean_unused_bs_targets(partitions)

    # Step 4 — reconnect BS input connections
    evp.core.reconnect_bs_inputs(source, partitions)

    # Step 5 — copy skin clusters
    evp.core.copy_skin_clusters(source, partitions)

    # Step 6 — remove unused influences
    evp.core.remove_unused_influences(partitions)

    # Step 7 — copy skin configuration and reproduce localization
    evp.core.copy_skin_configuration(source, partitions)
    evp.core.reproduce_skin_localization(source, partitions)

    # Step 8 — create the proximity wrap proxy
    proxy = evp.core.create_proximity_wrap_proxy(source, partitions, grp, manager)

``.evp`` configuration format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of schema **v2.0**, ``.evp`` files store the target mesh as a **short name** rather than a full DAG path. This makes configurations portable across scenes, namespaces, and rig reorganizations — the tool resolves the short name to the actual node in the current scene at load time.

Backwards compatibility:

* Existing v1.0 ``.evp`` files (which store the long path) still load. If the stored long path still resolves, it is used verbatim; otherwise the tool falls back to a short-name lookup using the ``mesh_short_name`` field.
* Re-saving a v1.0 file writes it out as v2.0 automatically.

Ambiguity:

* If the short name in a config matches **more than one** mesh transform in the current scene, ``apply_configuration`` raises ``RuntimeError`` listing every match. Rename the conflicting nodes, or pass ``mesh=`` explicitly to disambiguate:

  .. code-block:: python

      manager = evp.core.execute_from_file(
          "D:/configs/character_body.evp",
          mesh="|rig|geo|body",   # explicit long path wins
      )

.. _blendshape-transfer:

Blendshape Setup Transfer
=========================

The Blendshape Setup Transfer tool transfers blendshape targets from one or more source meshes into a single blendShape node on a target mesh. It supports combo multiply networks, in-between targets, and preserves all alias names.

Access from the menu: **mGear > Rigbits > Blendshape Setup Transfer**

.. image:: images/rigbits/Blendshape_setup_transfer.png
    :align: center

Features
--------

**Multi-Source Transfer**

Transfer blendshape targets from multiple source meshes simultaneously. All targets are stacked into a single blendShape node on the target mesh with unique alias names. Name collisions are resolved by prefixing the source mesh name.

**Combo Network Rebuild**

For targets driven by SHAPES combo connections (multiply networks using ``multDL`` or ``multDoubleLinear`` nodes), the tool rebuilds an independent multiply chain on the target blendShape. The source combo network is never modified.

**Zero-Delta Cleanup**

Targets that produce no visible deformation on the target mesh are automatically detected and skipped during transfer, keeping the result clean.

**Connection Reconnection**

Simple weight drivers (animCurves, weightDrivers, etc.) are connected from the source to the corresponding target weight. Combo networks are rebuilt from scratch using the target's own weights as inputs.

Usage
-----

1. Set the **Target Mesh** using the ``<<`` button to load from selection
2. Add one or more **Source Meshes** using **Add from Selection**
3. Optionally set a custom **BS Node Name**
4. Enable or disable **Reconnect connections**
5. Click **Execute Transfer**

Configuration
-------------

Save and load transfer configurations using the **File** menu.

- **Export Config**: Save target, sources, and options to a ``.bst`` file
- **Import Config**: Load a previously saved ``.bst`` file and populate the UI

Scripting Access
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.core import blendshape

    # Transfer from multiple sources to a target
    result = blendshape.transfer_blendshapes(
        sources=["source_head", "source_jaw"],
        target="target_body",
        bs_node_name="body_BS",
        reconnect=True,
    )

    # Run from a saved config file
    from mgear.rigbits.blendshape_transfer import core
    config = core.import_config("/path/to/config.bst")
    core.run_from_config(config)


.. _lattice-io:

Lattice IO
==========

Lattice IO exports ffd lattice deformers to a ``.lat`` file and rebuilds them, so hand-placed lattices survive a rig rebuild. Use the tool to export, then rebuild the lattices in the Shifter build with the **Import Lattice Configuration** custom step template.

Access from the menu: **mGear > Rigbits > Lattice IO**

With mGear file drop enabled (see :ref:`file-drop`), dropping a ``.lat`` file into Maya rebuilds its lattices.

What is Saved
-------------

- **ffd settings**: local influence, outside lattice and falloff, partial resolution, bind to original geometry, freeze geometry and envelope
- **Lattice and base**: names, parent, world matrix and visibility
- **Lattice shape**: divisions and the position of every lattice point
- **Affected geometry**: the deformed shapes, their deformer set members or component tag expression, and the weight map (only the weights that are not 1.0 are stored)
- **Deformer order**: the deformer stack of each geometry and the order mode chosen on export

Export
------

.. image:: images/rigbits/lattice_IO_export.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

1. Open the **Export** tab. It lists the lattices in the scene. Use **From Selection** to select the lattices of the selected objects (lattices, base lattices or deformed geometry).
2. Choose the **Deformer order** to store with the lattices (see below). It always starts as **Current** when the tool opens.
3. Click **Export Selected...** and save the ``.lat`` file.

Import
------

.. image:: images/rigbits/lattice_IO_import.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

1. Open the **Import** tab and browse to a ``.lat`` file, or use **File > Recent Files**. The file content is listed with the divisions, the geometry and whether weights are stored.
2. Uncheck the lattices you don't want to import.
3. The **Order** column shows the deformer order stored for each lattice. Change it to override it for this import only.
4. Keep **Replace existing** checked to delete lattices with the same names first, including orphan lattice or base nodes left by a broken setup, so the rebuilt nodes keep their exact names.
5. Click **Import Checked**. The whole import is a single undo step.

Geometry and parents are found by name, even if they moved in the hierarchy or are in another namespace. Missing geometry is skipped with a warning in the log panel.

.. note::
    Component tag expressions are restored, but the component tags themselves are not saved. Make sure the tags exist on the rebuilt geometry.

Deformer Order
--------------

The deformer order sets where the ffd goes in the deformer stack of each geometry:

- **Current (as exported)**: the position the ffd had when it was exported. It goes directly after the closest deformer that was evaluated before it and still exists. If the ffd was the first deformer, it goes to the front of the chain. If its position can't be found, it is added last.
- **Front of chain**: before all the existing deformers.
- **Last (append)**: after all the existing deformers, the same as applying a new lattice.

The order chosen on export is saved for each lattice in the ``.lat`` file, so the custom step and scripted imports rebuild the lattices in the intended order without extra settings.

Shifter Custom Step
-------------------

Create a custom step from the **Import Lattice Configuration** template (see :ref:`custom-step-templates`) and set its options in ``setup()``:

- ``self.lattice_path``: the ``.lat`` file. Leave it as ``None`` to pick the file when the step runs.
- ``self.lattice_names``: the ffd names to import, ``None`` for all.
- ``self.replace``: delete lattices with the same names first.
- ``self.order``: ``None`` uses the order stored in the file. Use ``"current"``, ``"front"`` or ``"last"`` to override it.

File Format
-----------

``.lat`` files are JSON. The ``type`` key is ``"lattice_config"``. Files exported as ``.json`` with the same content (from the original lattice serializer script) can also be imported.

Scripting Access
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits import lattice_io

    # Export
    lattice_io.export_lattices(["face_ffd", "belly_ffd"], "C:/rig/data/lattices.lat")

    # Import everything with the stored order
    lattice_io.import_lattices("C:/rig/data/lattices.lat")

    # Import one lattice, appended after the existing deformers
    lattice_io.import_lattices(
        "C:/rig/data/lattices.lat",
        names=["face_ffd"],
        order="last",
    )

    # Override the order per lattice
    lattice_io.import_lattices(
        "C:/rig/data/lattices.lat",
        order={"face_ffd": "front"},
    )

The generic helpers used by the tool are available in ``mgear.core.deformer`` for other tools: ``get_deformer_stack``, ``move_deformer``, ``get_deformer_weights``, ``set_deformer_weights``, ``get_lattice_points``, ``set_lattice_points``, ``find_ffd_nodes`` and ``delete_lattice``.


.. _shrinkwrap-io:

Shrink Wrap IO
==============

Shrink Wrap IO exports Maya shrinkWrap deformers to a ``.shw`` file and rebuilds them, so the shrink wraps used to fit clothing, accessories or proxies onto a body survive a rig rebuild. It works the same way as :ref:`lattice-io`: export with the tool, then rebuild the shrink wraps in the Shifter build with the **Import Shrink Wrap Configuration** custom step template.

Access from the menu: **mGear > Rigbits > Shrink Wrap IO**

With mGear file drop enabled (see :ref:`file-drop`), dropping a ``.shw`` file into Maya rebuilds its shrink wraps.

What is Saved
-------------

- **Settings**: projection, closest if no intersection, reverse, bidirectional, axis options, offset, target inflation, falloff and falloff iterations, shape preservation, target smoothing (smooth level, continuity, UVs, borders, hard edges) and envelope
- **Target mesh**: the mesh the geometry is wrapped onto
- **Connections**: every connection driving the shrink wrap, apart from the deformed geometry itself: the target and optional inner mesh, and any rig control driving a setting such as the envelope
- **Affected geometry**: the deformed shapes, their deformer set members or component tag expression, and the weight map (only the weights that are not 1.0 are stored)
- **Deformer order**: the deformer stack of each geometry and the order mode chosen on export

Export
------

.. image:: images/rigbits/shirnkwrap_IO_export.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

1. Open the **Export** tab. It lists the shrink wraps in the scene with their target. Use **From Selection** to select the shrink wraps of the selected objects: shrink wraps, deformed geometry, or target and inner meshes.
2. Choose the **Deformer order** to store with the shrink wraps (see :ref:`lattice-io` for the modes). It always starts as **Current** when the tool opens.
3. Click **Export Selected...** and save the ``.shw`` file. Shrink wraps without a target mesh are skipped with a warning.

Import
------

.. image:: images/rigbits/shirnkwrap_IO_import.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

1. Open the **Import** tab and browse to a ``.shw`` file, or use **File > Recent Files**. The file content is listed with the target, the geometry and whether weights are stored.
2. Uncheck the shrink wraps you don't want to import.
3. Change the **Order** of a shrink wrap to override the stored deformer order for this import only.
4. Keep **Replace existing** checked to delete shrink wraps with the same names first. Only the shrink wrap node is deleted: the target and deformed meshes are kept.
5. Click **Import Checked**. The whole import is a single undo step.

The target mesh must exist in the scene: a shrink wrap whose target can't be found is skipped with a warning. Geometry, targets and driving controls are found by name, even if they moved in the hierarchy or are in another namespace. A missing driving control is reported in the log panel and the setting keeps the exported value.

Shifter Custom Step
-------------------

Create a custom step from the **Import Shrink Wrap Configuration** template (see :ref:`custom-step-templates`) and set its options in ``setup()``:

- ``self.shrinkwrap_path``: the ``.shw`` file. Leave it as ``None`` to pick the file when the step runs.
- ``self.shrinkwrap_names``: the shrink wrap names to import, ``None`` for all.
- ``self.replace``: delete shrink wraps with the same names first.
- ``self.order``: ``None`` uses the order stored in the file. Use ``"current"``, ``"front"`` or ``"last"`` to override it.

Run the step after the target meshes and the controls that drive the shrink wraps exist in the rig.

File Format
-----------

``.shw`` files are JSON. The ``type`` key is ``"shrinkwrap_config"``.

Scripting Access
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits import shrinkwrap_io

    # Export
    shrinkwrap_io.export_shrinkwraps(["shirt_sw", "belt_sw"], "C:/rig/data/cloth.shw")

    # Import everything with the stored order
    shrinkwrap_io.import_shrinkwraps("C:/rig/data/cloth.shw")

    # Import one shrink wrap, appended after the existing deformers
    shrinkwrap_io.import_shrinkwraps(
        "C:/rig/data/cloth.shw",
        names=["shirt_sw"],
        order="last",
    )

Lattice IO and Shrink Wrap IO share ``mgear.core.deformer_io``, a generic layer to save and rebuild deformers (file envelope, deformer order modes, geometry data, attributes and connections). Use it to add the same workflow to other deformer types.


.. _proximitywrap-io:

Proximity Wrap IO
=================

Proximity Wrap IO exports Maya proximityWrap deformers to a ``.pxw`` file and rebuilds them, so the proximity wraps used for clothing, accessories, proxies or partitioned meshes survive a rig rebuild. It works the same way as :ref:`lattice-io` and :ref:`shrinkwrap-io`: export with the tool, then rebuild the proximity wraps in the Shifter build with the **Import Proximity Wrap Configuration** custom step template.

Access from the menu: **mGear > Rigbits > Proximity Wrap IO**

With mGear file drop enabled (see :ref:`file-drop`), dropping a ``.pxw`` file into Maya rebuilds its proximity wraps, with a warning when the skinned meshes are not at their bind pose.

What is Saved
-------------

- **Settings**: wrap mode, falloff and dropoff rate scale, scale compensation, coordinate frames, smooth normals, span samples, smooth influences, soft normalization, bind tags, max drivers and envelope, plus the falloff ramp
- **Drivers**: every driver mesh, in order, with its own settings (falloff start and end, dropoff rate, strength, use transform as deformation, scale compensation, smooth normals, span samples and smooth influences with their overrides, driver wrap mode) and its own falloff ramp
- **Connections**: every connection driving the proximity wrap, apart from the deformed geometry and the driver meshes themselves, for example a rig control driving the envelope or a driver strength
- **Affected geometry**: the deformed shapes, their deformer set members or component tag expression, and the weight map (only the weights that are not 1.0 are stored)
- **Deformer order**: the deformer stack of each geometry and the order mode chosen on export

Export
------

.. image:: images/rigbits/proximityWrap_IO_export.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

1. Open the **Export** tab. It lists the proximity wraps in the scene with their number of drivers and geometry. Use **From Selection** to select the proximity wraps of the selected objects: proximity wraps, deformed geometry, driver meshes or controls driving them. Selecting a proximity wrap in the list selects its driver meshes.
2. Choose the **Deformer order** to store with the proximity wraps (see :ref:`lattice-io` for the modes). It always starts as **Current** when the tool opens.
3. Click **Export Selected...** and save the ``.pxw`` file. Proximity wraps without drivers are skipped with a warning.

Import
------

.. image:: images/rigbits/proximityWrap_IO_import.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

1. Open the **Import** tab and browse to a ``.pxw`` file, or use **File > Recent Files**. The file content is listed with the drivers, the geometry and whether weights are stored.
2. Uncheck the proximity wraps you don't want to import.
3. Change the **Order** of a proximity wrap to override the stored deformer order for this import only.
4. Keep **Replace existing** checked to delete proximity wraps with the same names first. Only the proximity wrap node is deleted: the driver and deformed meshes are kept.
5. Click **Import Checked**. The whole import is a single undo step.

.. important::
    Like when a driver is added in Maya, the drivers are bound again at their shape when you import. Import with the rig at bind pose. In a Shifter build, custom steps run at bind pose.

Missing driver meshes are skipped with a warning, and the proximity wrap is built with the drivers that exist. A proximity wrap with no driver left is skipped. Geometry, drivers and driving controls are found by name, even if they moved in the hierarchy or are in another namespace. Settings that don't exist in your Maya version are skipped and listed in the log panel.

Shifter Custom Step
-------------------

Create a custom step from the **Import Proximity Wrap Configuration** template (see :ref:`custom-step-templates`) and set its options in ``setup()``:

- ``self.proximitywrap_path``: the ``.pxw`` file. Leave it as ``None`` to pick the file when the step runs.
- ``self.proximitywrap_names``: the proximity wrap names to import, ``None`` for all.
- ``self.replace``: delete proximity wraps with the same names first.
- ``self.order``: ``None`` uses the order stored in the file. Use ``"current"``, ``"front"`` or ``"last"`` to override it.

Run the step after the driver meshes and the controls that drive the proximity wraps exist in the rig.

File Format
-----------

``.pxw`` files are JSON. The ``type`` key is ``"proximitywrap_config"``.

Scripting Access
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits import proximitywrap_io

    # Export
    proximitywrap_io.export_proximitywraps(["shirt_pw"], "C:/rig/data/cloth.pxw")

    # Import everything with the stored order
    proximitywrap_io.import_proximitywraps("C:/rig/data/cloth.pxw")

To create a proximity wrap from a script, use ``mgear.core.deformer.create_proximity_wrap``. Its optional ``wrap_mode`` argument sets the wrap mode, as an index or a name (``"offset"``, ``"surface"``, ``"snap"``, ``"rigid"`` or ``"cluster"``). When it is not given, Maya's default (surface) is kept.

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.core import deformer

    deformer.create_proximity_wrap("shirt", ["body", "arms"], wrap_mode="snap")


SDK Creator
===========

Reads keyframed poses from the timeline and creates **Set Driven Key** setups. It converts animation data into SDK transform nodes with animCurve graphs driven by attributes on a UIHost control.

.. image:: images/rigbits/SDK_Creator_UI.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 80%

Workflow
--------

1. Select a **UIHost** control (the node that will hold the driver attributes)
2. Add the **controls** that have keyframed poses on the timeline
3. Click **Detect Poses** to read keyframes — the tool finds all keyed frames and lists them with editable pose names
4. Adjust the **Min/Max** range for the driver attributes (default 0–1)
5. Click **Apply** to generate the SDK setup

The tool creates:

- An ``_sdk`` transform above each control (like an NPO but for SDK offsets)
- A driver attribute per pose on the UIHost control
- ``animCurve`` and ``blendWeighted`` nodes connecting the poses to control channels

Mirror
------

The **Mirror** tab creates a symmetrical copy of the SDK setup by applying search/replace naming and optional channel negation.

- **Search/Replace**: Renames controls and UIHost (e.g. ``_L`` → ``_R``)
- **Negate Channels**: Flips the specified transform channels (tx, ty, tz, rx, ry, rz, sx, sy, sz) to achieve mirror behavior

Configuration
-------------

Save and load SDK setups using the **File** menu.

- **Export Config**: Save the SDK setup to a ``.sdkc`` file
- **Export Mirror Config**: Export a mirrored version directly
- **Import Config**: Load a ``.sdkc`` file into the UI
- **Apply from File**: Apply an SDK setup directly from a file without loading the UI

The **Edit** menu provides **Delete SDK Setup from Controls** to cleanly remove SDK transforms and orphaned driver attributes.

Scripting Access
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from mgear.rigbits.sdk_creator import core

    # Apply from a saved config file
    core.apply_from_file("/path/to/config.sdkc")

    # Mirror an existing config
    config = core.import_config("/path/to/config.sdkc")
    mirrored = core.mirror_config(
        config, search="_L", replace="_R",
        negate_channels=["tx", "rz", "ry"],
    )
    core.apply_from_config(mirrored)
